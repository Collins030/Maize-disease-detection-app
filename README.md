#🌽 Maize Disease Detection App
Welcome to the Maize Disease Detection App, a user-friendly machine learning-powered application designed to identify diseases in maize crops. With just an image of a maize leaf, this app provides accurate predictions and actionable solutions to help farmers tackle crop diseases efficiently.

#🚀 Features
Disease Detection: Upload an image of a maize leaf to identify common maize diseases.
Detailed Recommendations: Get actionable solutions and recommended treatments for the detected disease.
Confidence Score: Understand how confident the model is about its prediction.
User-Friendly: Beginner-friendly interface and simple-to-use API.
📸 Supported Maize Diseases
The app can detect the following maize conditions:

Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot
🛠 Solution: Use Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil-based fungicides.
Common Rust
🛠 Solution: Apply Azoxystrobin or Tebuconazole fungicides.
Northern Leaf Blight
🛠 Solution: Use Propiconazole or Mancozeb fungicides.
Healthy Maize
🌱 Solution: No action needed! Your maize is healthy.
🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI
Frontend: Compatible with any web app or tool capable of API integration.
Machine Learning Model: TensorFlow for deep learning-based image classification.
Deployment: Run locally with uvicorn.
🛠 Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get started with the Maize Disease Detection App:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/Collins030/Maize-disease-detection-app.git
cd Maize-disease-detection-app
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash

pip install fastapi uvicorn tensorflow pillow numpy
3️⃣ Download the Model
Place your trained maize disease detection model (maize_model.h5) in the appropriate directory:

javascript

C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Documents/maize_disease_detection/model/
4️⃣ Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server:

bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
5️⃣ Test the API
Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to test the app's endpoints using FastAPI's interactive documentation.

🔗 API Endpoints
1. Predict Disease
Upload an image to predict maize diseases.

Endpoint: /predict
Method: POST
Parameters: UploadFile (image)
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "class": "Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_",
  "confidence": 0.97,
  "recommendation": {
    "solution": "Apply fungicides containing Azoxystrobin or Tebuconazole.",
    "chemicals": [
      {
        "name": "Azoxystrobin",
        "dosage": "2ml per liter of water",
        "procedure": "Apply at disease onset and repeat every 10–14 days.",
        "image_url": "https://example.com/images/azoxystrobin.jpg"
      }
    ]
  }
}
🌱 How It Works
Upload a clear image of a maize leaf showing symptoms (if any).
The machine learning model analyzes the image and predicts the disease.
The app provides actionable solutions and recommended treatments.
